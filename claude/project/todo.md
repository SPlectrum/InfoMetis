# Repository Todo List

## Current Session Status - READY FOR NIFI DEPLOYMENT

### üéâ Major Breakthrough Achieved
**WSL Socket Issues Completely Resolved** - K0s works perfectly on Linux filesystem

### ‚úÖ Session 2025-06-27 Completed Tasks

#### WSL & K0s Investigation  
- **k0s-linux-test**: Test k0s on Linux filesystem - WSL socket issues RESOLVED (HIGH)
- **k0s-worker-debug**: Debug k0s worker node registration - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED (HIGH)  
- **k0s-system-install**: Install k0s system-wide - WORKER REGISTRATION SUCCESSFUL (HIGH)
- **k0s-cleanup**: Clean up k0s system installation due to sudo complexity (HIGH)
- **runtime-isolation**: Create isolated k0s runtime folder with gitignore (MEDIUM)

#### Docker Deployment Setup
- **docker-compose-setup**: Create simple Docker Compose NiFi deployment (HIGH)
- **sample-data-creation**: Create sample CSV data for processing pipeline (MEDIUM)
- **docker-permissions**: Add user to docker group for non-sudo access (MEDIUM)

### üîÑ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Ready to Execute)

#### 1. Start NiFi Container (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
# After logout/login or new terminal for docker group:
docker compose up -d

# OR with sudo if group not active:
sudo docker compose up -d

# Check status:
docker compose ps
```

#### 2. Access NiFi UI (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Username**: admin  
- **Password**: adminpassword
- **Expected**: NiFi login screen and dashboard

#### 3. Create Basic File Processing Pipeline (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Use sample data: `data/nifi/input/sample_data.csv`
- Create simple file-to-file processor
- Output to: `data/nifi/output/`
- Test end-to-end data flow

#### 4. Validate Prototype Functionality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Verify file processing works
- Check output data quality
- Document working pipeline configuration

## Session Progress Summary

### Key Technical Insights Discovered
1. **WSL Socket Resolution**: Moving to Linux filesystem completely resolves k0s socket issues
2. **K0s Worker Registration**: Requires system installation (`sudo k0s install controller --single`) 
3. **Simple Docker Approach**: Much simpler for prototype development than Kubernetes complexity

### Files Created This Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Simple NiFi deployment with persistent volumes
- `data/nifi/input/sample_data.csv` - Sample order data for processing
- `data/nifi/output/` - Directory for processed output
- `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude runtime data

### Technical Architecture Validated
- **NiFi Container**: apache/nifi:latest with persistent storage
- **Data Volumes**: Separated input/output for clean data flow  
- **Authentication**: Single user admin setup for development
- **Port Mapping**: Standard 8080 for web UI access

### Files Cleaned Up
- Removed `k0s-runtime/` directory (too complex for prototype)
- Removed k0s system installation (sudo requirements)
- Simplified to Docker-only approach
