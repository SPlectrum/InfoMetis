# InfoMetis - Implementation Plan Outline

## Overview

This document captures the high-level implementation plan derived from initial project analysis. This represents the major areas of work that will need to be addressed during InfoMetis development.

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Project Analysis and Architecture Patterns
- Analyze InfoMetis project requirements and architecture patterns
- Define architectural principles and design patterns
- Establish component interaction models

### 2. Project Structure and Documentation
- Set up initial project directory structure and documentation
- Create development environment setup
- Establish coding standards and conventions

### 3. Core Components Definition
- Define core components and their responsibilities (single concern pattern)
- Establish component boundaries and interfaces
- Design component interaction patterns

### 4. Internal Networking Design
- Design internal networking and communication rules
- Implement service discovery mechanisms
- Create internal communication protocols

### 5. Configuration Template System
- Design configuration template system for multi-environment deployment
- Create template abstraction layer
- Implement environment-specific configuration injection

### 6. Border Security Model
- Define border security model for ingress/egress complexity
- Implement security policy enforcement
- Create authentication and authorization framework

## Implementation Approach

This plan follows the **single-step execution** methodology:
- Each area will be broken down into individual, completable steps
- Only one step executed at a time
- Choice points after each step completion
- Progress tracked through operational todo system

## Status

**Current Phase**: Preliminary Discussion
**Next Phase**: Detailed component design and initial prototyping
