# InfoMetis - Initial Project Analysis

## Project Overview

InfoMetis - container orchestration made simple with a **"complexity at the border"** philosophy.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Concern Pattern
- Each component handles one primary aspect
- Components can handle multiple related concerns (e.g., Traefik: routing + auth + certificates)
- Clear separation of responsibilities

### 2. Internal Simplicity
- Clear text communication between internal services
- Encrypted network transport layer (clear text over encrypted transport)
- Simple internal service deployment and interaction

### 3. Border Complexity
- All external interaction complexity handled at ingress/egress points
- Internal services remain simple and focused
- Production complexity abstracted to platform boundary

### 4. Template-Based Configuration
- Environment-agnostic core configuration
- Environment-specific requirements handled at the border
- Same templates valid for dev, UAT, and production

## Key Components Identified

### Core Infrastructure
- **Traefik**: Routing, authentication, certificates, load balancing
- **Network Layer**: Encrypted internal mesh with clear text application communication
- **Container Runtime**: Simple internal service deployment
- **Template Engine**: Environment-portable configuration system
- **Border Gateway**: Ingress/egress policy enforcement

### Internal Services (Examples)
- Kafka: Message streaming
- Elasticsearch: Search and analytics
- NiFi: Data flow processing

## Multi-Environment Strategy

### Core Concept
- **Identical Internal**: Core services run identically across all environments
- **Environment-Specific Border**: Dev/UAT/Prod differences handled at platform boundary
- **Template Abstraction**: Configuration templates hide environment complexity

### Environment Differentiation Points
- Security policies (production-grade vs development)
- Scaling requirements
- Monitoring and observability depth
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Performance and resource allocation

## Communication Model

### Internal Communication
- Clear text protocols between services
- Encrypted network transport (e.g., Wireguard, TLS mesh)
- Simple service discovery and networking rules
- Focus on functionality over security complexity

### Border Communication
- Full security stack at ingress/egress
- Authentication and authorization enforcement
- Certificate management
- External protocol handling
- Security scanning and policy enforcement

## Next Steps for Discussion

1. Define specific component responsibilities
2. Design internal networking and service discovery
3. Specify template system requirements
4. Detail border security model
5. Plan initial prototype scope
