# InfoMetis - Project Scope and Priorities

## Service Selection & Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: NiFi-Centric Prototyping
**Primary Focus**: NiFi for prototyping data pipelines
- **Rationale**: Most pressing need for pipeline development
- **Scope**: Basic NiFi deployment with UI access
- **Goal**: Rapid pipeline prototyping capability

### Phase 2: Processing Unit (Kafka - NiFi - ES)
**Service Group**: Integrated processing unit
- **Kafka**: Message streaming and data ingestion
- **NiFi**: Data processing and transformation pipelines
- **Elasticsearch**: Search, analytics, and data storage
- **Integration**: Services work together as cohesive processing unit
- **UI Access**: Direct access to service UIs for development and monitoring

### Service Grouping Philosophy
**Processing Units**: Groups of services that work together as logical units
- **Unit Boundaries**: Clear interfaces between processing units
- **Internal Cohesion**: Services within unit tightly integrated
- **External Separation**: Units interact through well-defined APIs
- **Scalability**: Units can be scaled independently

## Data Flow Strategy

### Current Approach
**Design-Driven**: Data flows will be designed when specific use cases are implemented
- **Flexibility**: Avoid premature architectural decisions
- **Use-Case Focused**: Let actual requirements drive data flow patterns
- **Iterative Design**: Evolve data patterns as understanding develops

### Future Considerations
- Service-to-service communication patterns
- Data schema management
- External data source integration patterns

## Security Model

### Internal Security Philosophy
**Minimal Internal Security**: "As non-existent as possible within a unit"
- **Trust Boundary**: Processing unit boundary defines security perimeter
- **Internal Communication**: Clear text, minimal authentication overhead
- **Operational Simplicity**: Reduce internal complexity and debugging difficulty

### Protection Strategy
**Encryption-Based Protection**:
- **Network Encryption**: Prevent internal crossover between units
- **External Eavesdropping Protection**: Secure transport for all external communication
- **Border Security**: All external security complexity handled at unit boundary

### Implementation Approach
- Internal services communicate without authentication barriers
- Network-level encryption provides confidentiality
- Security policies enforced at processing unit ingress/egress

## Monitoring & Observability

### Ground-Up Design Philosophy
**Built-in Observability**: Monitoring and observability designed from the beginning
- **Not Afterthought**: Integral part of architecture, not added later
- **Orchestration Support**: Observability data required for eventual consistency approach
- **Operational Intelligence**: Data feeds back into reconciliation and decision-making

### Observability Requirements
**For Eventual Consistency**:
- Configuration drift detection
- Reconciliation success/failure tracking
- Service health and dependency status
- Data flow monitoring and bottleneck detection

### Implementation Strategy
- Metrics collection built into every service
- Centralized observability within processing unit
- Cross-unit observability aggregation
- Real-time dashboards for operational awareness

## Development Workflow

### Ownership Model
**End-to-End Responsibility**: "We own the specific dev to prod (via UAT etc.)"
- **Complete Pipeline**: InfoMetis team controls entire development lifecycle
- **Environment Consistency**: Same approach across all environments
- **Quality Gates**: Consistent standards from development through production

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**TDD from Ground Up**: Test-driven development as core methodology
- **Service-Level TDD**: Each service developed with comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration TDD**: Inter-service communication tested from design phase
- **Infrastructure TDD**: Infrastructure configuration tested and validated
- **End-to-End TDD**: Complete processing unit functionality tested

### Implementation Approach
- Tests written before implementation
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Test-driven infrastructure deployment
- Quality gates at each environment promotion

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Eventual Consistency Approach
**Self-Healing Systems**: Eventual consistency with external escalation
- **Local Recovery**: Services attempt local recovery and reconciliation
- **Escalation Points**: Configurable external callouts when local recovery fails
- **Graceful Degradation**: Systems continue operating with reduced functionality when possible

### Resilience Strategy
**Configurable External Callouts**:
- **Alerting**: Configurable notification when manual intervention required
- **Escalation Policies**: Different escalation strategies for different error types
- **Recovery Automation**: Automated recovery where safe and predictable
- **Manual Intervention**: Clear escalation to human operators for complex failures

### Implementation Principles
- Design for partial failure and recovery
- Clear boundaries between automated and manual recovery
- Comprehensive error logging and tracing
- Configurable resilience policies per service and environment

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: NiFi Foundation
1. **NiFi Core Deployment**: Basic NiFi with UI access
2. **Basic Monitoring**: Essential observability for NiFi
3. **TDD Infrastructure**: Test framework for NiFi deployment
4. **Event-Driven Config**: Basic reconciliation for NiFi configuration

### Phase 2: Processing Unit Integration
1. **Kafka Integration**: Add Kafka to processing unit
2. **Elasticsearch Integration**: Complete Kafka-NiFi-ES unit
3. **Inter-Service Communication**: Implement internal communication patterns
4. **Unit-Level Monitoring**: Comprehensive processing unit observability

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
1. **Multi-Mode Deployment**: Independent and shared cluster support
2. **Advanced Resilience**: Full error handling and recovery
3. **Security Hardening**: Production-grade security implementation
4. **Operational Tooling**: Complete monitoring and management capabilities
