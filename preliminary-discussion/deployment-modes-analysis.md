# InfoMetis - Deployment Modes Analysis

## Overview

InfoMetis must operate seamlessly across different deployment environments, from independent clusters to shared production environments with varying constraints and policies.

## Deployment Environment Constraints

### Shared Cluster Reality
- **Limited Configuration Flexibility**: Restricted access to cluster-wide networking and security policies
- **Shared Resources**: Clusters contain deployments we don't own or control
- **Integration Requirements**: Must work within existing cluster networking configurations
- **Self-Contained Necessity**: Solution must be as autonomous as possible within assigned boundaries

### Multi-Mode Requirement
InfoMetis must operate seamlessly in multiple deployment modes without changing core service definitions.

## Deployment Modes

### Mode 1: Independent Deployment (k0s)
**Environment**: Full cluster control
- Direct resource management and configuration
- Complete networking control
- Ideal for development, testing, and edge deployments
- Simple operational model

**Networking**: 
- Full Traefik configuration with LoadBalancer services
- Direct k0s native networking or Traefik internal routing
- Complete control over ingress and security policies

### Mode 2: Shared Cluster Deployment (k8s + FluxCD)
**Environment**: Limited cluster permissions within shared infrastructure
- Namespaced deployment with restricted RBAC
- Integration with existing cluster networking
- Production-ready isolation and security
- FluxCD-managed deployment lifecycle

**Networking**:
- Self-contained Traefik deployment within assigned namespace(s)
- ClusterIP services with integration to existing ingress controllers
- Adaptation to existing cluster security policies

### Mode 3: Various Shared Configurations
**Environment**: Different shared cluster policies and constraints
- Varying ingress/networking restrictions
- Different security requirements and compliance needs
- Custom organizational policies and tooling
- Multiple integration patterns

**Networking**:
- Adaptive networking configuration based on cluster capabilities
- Integration with diverse existing infrastructure
- Flexible border configuration to match environment constraints

## Critical Architecture Requirements

### Template System as Core Abstraction
The configuration template system becomes the **most critical component** as it must:
- Generate appropriate manifests for each deployment mode automatically
- Maintain identical internal service definitions across all modes
- Adapt border complexity to deployment environment constraints
- Provide seamless transition between deployment modes

### Service Definition Consistency
Same InfoMetis service definitions (Kafka, Elasticsearch, NiFi, etc.) must:
- Deploy identically across all modes
- Maintain consistent internal communication patterns
- Adapt networking integration without changing service behavior
- Preserve operational simplicity regardless of deployment complexity

### Border Adaptation Strategy
```
[Various Shared K8s Clusters - Different Constraints]
  ↓ [Adaptive Integration Points]
[InfoMetis Border - Environment-Aware]
  ↓ [Consistent Internal Zone]  
[InfoMetis Services - Mode-Agnostic]
```

## Design Implications

### Networking Strategy
- **Internal consistency**: Same internal networking regardless of deployment mode
- **Border flexibility**: Adaptive external integration based on environment constraints
- **Self-contained capability**: Can operate independently of cluster networking policies

### Configuration Management
- **Single source of truth**: One configuration defines desired state across all modes
- **Mode detection**: Automatic adaptation to deployment environment capabilities
- **Override capability**: Environment-specific customization without breaking consistency

### FluxCD Integration
- **Production deployment**: GitOps workflow for shared cluster environments
- **Template compatibility**: Generate FluxCD-compatible manifests
- **Environment promotion**: Same templates across dev/uat/prod with mode-specific adaptation

## Next Steps

1. Design template system architecture for multi-mode deployment capability
2. Define mode detection and adaptation mechanisms
3. Specify networking strategy for each deployment mode
4. Plan FluxCD integration patterns
