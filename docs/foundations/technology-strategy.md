# InfoMetis Technology Strategy

## Technology Selection Philosophy

InfoMetis technology choices prioritize **operational simplicity**, **multi-environment consistency**, and **long-term maintainability** over cutting-edge features or vendor-specific optimization.

## Core Platform Technologies

### Container Orchestration

**Primary: Kubernetes Ecosystem**
- **Production**: k0s (lightweight Kubernetes distribution)
- **Development**: kind (Kubernetes in Docker)

**Selection Rationale**:
- **k0s Benefits**: Minimal operational overhead, production-ready, edge-friendly
- **kind Benefits**: WSL compatibility, easy cleanup, full Kubernetes feature compatibility
- **Ecosystem Consistency**: Same orchestration patterns across environments
- **Industry Standard**: Kubernetes skills transfer and community support

**Alternative Considered**: Docker Compose
- **Rejected**: Lacks advanced orchestration features needed for multi-service coordination
- **Use Case**: Retained for simple development scenarios and initial prototyping

### Border Management

**Primary: Traefik**
- Edge router and reverse proxy
- Automatic service discovery and routing
- SSL/TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt integration
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Single component handling multiple border concerns

**Selection Rationale**:
- **Kubernetes Native**: Designed for container orchestration environments
- **Configuration Simplicity**: Automatic service discovery reduces configuration overhead
- **Feature Consolidation**: Single component handles routing, security, and certificates
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics and monitoring integration

**Alternative Considered**: nginx + cert-manager + separate auth
- **Rejected**: Multiple components increase complexity and failure points
- **Complexity**: Requires coordination between multiple configuration systems

### Service Communication

**Internal Protocols**:
- **HTTP/REST**: Synchronous service communication
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous processing (Kafka)
- **Clear Text**: Application protocols over encrypted transport

**External Protocols**:
- **HTTPS**: All external communication
- **WebSocket**: Real-time dashboard and monitoring
- **gRPC**: High-performance service integration where needed

**Selection Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Standard protocols reduce integration complexity
- **Debugging**: Clear text internal communication simplifies troubleshooting
- **Security**: Transport-level encryption provides security without application complexity
- **Compatibility**: Standard protocols ensure broad integration support

## Service Ecosystem Technologies

### Data Processing Stack

**Apache NiFi**
- **Role**: Data flow automation and pipeline management
- **Selection Rationale**: 
  - Visual pipeline design and management
  - Extensive connector ecosystem
  - Built-in data provenance and monitoring
  - Strong community and enterprise support

**NiFi Registry**
- **Role**: Pipeline version control and governance
- **Selection Rationale**:
  - Native NiFi integration
  - Git-based version control
  - Pipeline promotion across environments
  - Collaborative pipeline development

**Apache Kafka**
- **Role**: Message streaming and event processing
- **Selection Rationale**:
  - Industry standard for streaming data
  - High throughput and low latency
  - Strong ecosystem integration
  - Proven scalability and reliability

**Elasticsearch**
- **Role**: Search, analytics, and data storage
- **Selection Rationale**:
  - Powerful search and analytics capabilities
  - Strong integration with data processing tools
  - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting features
  - Scalable distributed architecture

**Grafana**
- **Role**: Monitoring, visualization, and operational dashboards
- **Selection Rationale**:
  - Excellent visualization capabilities
  - Multi-datasource support (Elasticsearch, metrics, logs)
  - Alerting and notification integration
  - Strong community and plugin ecosystem

### Supporting Technologies

**Configuration Management**:
- **Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets**: Environment-specific configuration
- **Kustomize**: Template processing and environment overlays
- **Git**: Version control for all configuration

**Monitoring and Observability**:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Loki**: Log aggregation and processing
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing (future consideration)
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding

**Development Tools**:
- **kind**: Local Kubernetes development
- **kubectl**: Kubernetes command-line interface
- **k9s**: Kubernetes cluster management UI
- **Docker**: Container building and local development

## Technology Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

**Primary Criteria**:
1. **Operational Simplicity**: Reduces ongoing maintenance overhead
2. **Multi-Environment Consistency**: Works identically across dev/UAT/prod
3. **Community Support**: Strong community and long-term viability
4. **Integration Compatibility**: Works well with existing technology choices

**Secondary Criteria**:
1. **Performance**: Adequate performance for expected workloads
2. **Scalability**: Can grow with platform adoption
3. **Security**: Strong security model and track record
4. **Cost**: Reasonable total cost of ownership

### Technology Evolution Strategy

**Stability First**: Prefer proven technologies with established track records
**Incremental Adoption**: Introduce new technologies through specific use cases
**Compatibility Focus**: Ensure new technologies integrate with existing stack
**Migration Planning**: Clear migration paths when technology changes are needed

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### WSL Development Environment

**Constraints**:
- Unix socket limitations affect some Kubernetes distributions
- File system performance differences
- Network access patterns different from native Linux

**Adaptations**:
- kind instead of k0s for WSL compatibility
- Specific volume mount patterns for performance
- Network configuration adjustments for WSL networking

### Production Environment Variations

**Shared Cluster Deployments**:
- Work within existing cluster policies and constraints
- Respect resource limits and networking restrictions
- Integrate with existing monitoring and security systems

**Independent Cluster Deployments**:
- Full control over cluster configuration
- Optimized resource allocation and networking
- Custom security and monitoring integration

## Technology Roadmap
