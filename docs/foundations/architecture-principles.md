# InfoMetis Architecture Principles

## Core Philosophy: Complexity at the Border

InfoMetis implements a **"complexity at the border"** architecture where all external complexity is handled at platform boundaries, while internal services remain simple and focused.

```
[External Environment - Variable & Complex]
  ↑↓ [All External Communication]
[Border Layer - Environment-Specific Adaptation]
  ↑↓ [Stable Internal Interface]  
[InfoMetis Core - Simple & Environment-Agnostic]
```

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Disciplined Separation of Concerns

**Internal Services (Simple)**:
- Service-to-service communication within InfoMetis
- Environment-agnostic operation
- Clear text protocols over encrypted transport
- Focus on business functionality

**Border Layer (Complex)**:
- All external interaction complexity
- Environment-specific adaptation
- Security, authentication, certificates
- Protocol translation and routing

### 2. Single Concern Pattern

Each component handles one primary responsibility:
- **Clear ownership**: Each service has defined scope
- **Related concerns allowed**: Components can handle multiple related aspects (e.g., Traefik: routing + auth + certificates)
- **No overlap**: Clear boundaries between component responsibilities

### 3. Internal Simplicity

**Communication Model**:
- Clear text application protocols between internal services
- Encrypted network transport layer (security without complexity)
- Simple service discovery and networking
- Minimal authentication barriers internally

**Design Goals**:
- Easy debugging and troubleshooting
- Straightforward service integration
- Reduced operational complexity
- Clear service interactions

### 4. Template-Based Configuration

**Environment Abstraction**:
- Core services identical across all environments
- Environment-specific requirements handled at border
- Same templates work for dev, UAT, and production
- Configuration differences isolated to adaptation layer

## Service Organization

### Processing Units

Services are grouped into **Processing Units** - cohesive groups that work together:

**Unit Characteristics**:
- **Internal cohesion**: Services within unit tightly integrated
- **External separation**: Units interact through well-defined APIs
- **Independent scaling**: Units can be scaled independently
- **Clear boundaries**: Explicit interfaces between units

**Example Processing Unit: Data Flow**:
- Kafka (message streaming)
- NiFi (data processing and transformation)
- Elasticsearch (search and analytics)
- Grafana (monitoring and visualization)

### Security Boundaries

**Trust Boundaries**:
- Processing unit boundary defines security perimeter
- Minimal security within processing units
- Full security enforcement at unit boundaries

**Security Model**:
- Network-level encryption for confidentiality
- Authentication and authorization at borders
- Internal services communicate with minimal barriers
- External security complexity handled at ingress/egress

## Multi-Environment Strategy

### Core Concept

**Identical Internal**: Core services run identically across all environments
**Environment-Specific Border**: Differences handled at platform boundary only

### Environment Differentiation

Environments differ only in:
- Security policies and compliance requirements
- Scaling and performance characteristics
- Monitoring depth and observability
- Resource allocation and limits

### Benefits

- **Consistent behavior**: Same service behavior across environments
- **Simplified testing**: Test once, deploy everywhere
- **Reduced complexity**: Environment complexity isolated
- **Easier troubleshooting**: Identical internal operation

## Development Philosophy

### Built-in Observability

**Ground-up Design**: Observability designed from the beginning, not added later

**Requirements**:
- Metrics collection built into every service
- Configuration drift detection
- Health and dependency status tracking
- Data flow monitoring and bottleneck detection

### Test-Driven Development

**TDD from Foundation**: Test-driven development as core methodology across all levels:
- Service-level TDD with comprehensive coverage
- Integration TDD for inter-service communication
- Infrastructure TDD for deployment validation
- End-to-end TDD for complete processing unit functionality

### Eventual Consistency

**Self-Healing Systems**: Local recovery with external escalation when needed

**Approach**:
- Services attempt local recovery and reconciliation
- Configurable external escalation when local recovery fails
- Graceful degradation with reduced functionality when possible
- Clear boundaries between automated and manual intervention

## Implementation Patterns

### Service Communication

**Internal Communication**:
- HTTP/REST for synchronous operations
- Message queues for asynchronous processing
- Clear, documented APIs between services
- Service discovery through orchestration layer

**External Communication**:
- All external protocols handled at border
- Authentication and encryption at ingress/egress
- Protocol translation when needed
- External integration points clearly defined

### Configuration Management

**Template Approach**:
- Base templates for all service configurations
- Environment-specific overlays for border adaptation
- Version-controlled configuration evolution
- Automated configuration validation

### Error Handling

**Resilience Strategy**:
- Design for partial failure and recovery
- Comprehensive error logging and tracing
- Configurable resilience policies per service
- Clear escalation paths for complex failures

## Strategic Benefits

### Development Velocity

- Simple internal services are easier to develop and maintain
- Clear boundaries reduce integration complexity
- Template-based approach enables rapid environment setup
- Built-in observability supports faster debugging

### Operational Reliability

- Environment-agnostic core reduces deployment risks
- Border complexity isolation simplifies troubleshooting
- Self-healing capabilities reduce operational overhead
- Clear escalation paths ensure appropriate response to issues

### Platform Evolution

- Simple internal architecture supports easy service additions
- Clear boundaries enable independent service evolution
- Template approach supports new environment types
- Processing unit model scales to additional service groups
