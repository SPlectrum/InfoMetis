# InfoMetis Foundations

## Overview

This section contains the foundational architecture, principles, and long-term vision for InfoMetis as a Service Orchestration Platform. These documents provide the strategic foundation that guides all development work.

## Foundation Documents

### Core Architecture
- **[Architecture Principles](./architecture-principles.md)** - Fundamental design principles and patterns
- **[Service Orchestration Vision](./service-orchestration-vision.md)** - Long-term platform vision and capabilities
- **[Deployment Strategy](./deployment-strategy.md)** - Multi-environment deployment philosophy

### Technology Strategy
- **[Technology Strategy](./technology-strategy.md)** - Technology selection rationale and evolution

## Purpose

These foundation documents establish:

- **Architectural Guardrails**: Principles that ensure consistent development
- **Strategic Direction**: Long-term vision for platform evolution
- **Decision Framework**: Rationale for technology and design choices
- **Consistency**: Common understanding across all development phases

## Relationship to Current Work

**Foundations** (this section) provide the **long view** - strategic architecture and vision.

**Current Deliverables** ([NiFi WSL Dev Platform](../nifi-wsl-dev-platform/)) provide the **short view** - practical implementation steps.

All current work should align with these foundational principles while progressing toward the long-term vision through practical incremental steps.
