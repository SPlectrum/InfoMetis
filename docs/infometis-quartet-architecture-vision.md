# InfoMetis: Quartet Architecture Vision

## Executive Summary

InfoMetis serves as the **architectural laboratory** for developing and validating the quartet system architecture: SPlectrum (execution engine), InfoMetish (packaging), Sesameh (AI behavioral intelligence), and Carambah (solution composition). This document captures the architectural vision emerging from InfoMetis prototyping efforts.

## The Quartet Architecture

### Component Roles and Responsibilities

**SPlectrum - Execution Engine**
- Implementation of execution engine components
- API wrappers around third-party tools
- Platform-agnostic runtime environment
- Script execution and orchestration

**InfoMetish - Packaging & Deployment**
- Packages that execute on different platforms (Kubernetes, Linux OS, etc.)
- Contains generic/vanilla configurations
- Platform-specific deployment templates
- Self-extracting archives for distribution

**Sesameh - Behavioral Intelligence**
- Claude CAI behavioral components
- AI-driven orchestration and adaptation
- Intelligent decision making
- System optimization and learning

**Carambah - Solution Composition**
- Composes elements from other three components
- Dynamic, multi-step composition
- Business logic and workflows
- Solution-specific configurations

## InfoMetis as Prototyping Playground

InfoMetis is not a final product but rather a **prototyping environment** to understand and validate the quartet architecture. Through building a data platform, we're discovering the natural boundaries between components.

### Current InfoMetis Components Map to Future Architecture

**Platform Components (Future SPlectrum + InfoMetish):**
- `setup-cluster.sh` → InfoMetish (k8s platform packaging)
- `nifi-automation/scripts/` → SPlectrum (API execution wrappers)
- `deploy/kubernetes/` → InfoMetish (platform configurations)

**Solution Components (Future Carambah):**
- `templates/csv-processor.yaml` → Carambah (solution composition)
- `pipelines/customer-pipeline.yaml` → Carambah (business logic)
- Custom data processing workflows → Carambah (solution scripts)

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Platform vs Solution Classification

The fundamental question that guides component separation:
- **"Is it platform?"** → InfoMetish + SPlectrum
- **"Is it solution?"** → Carambah

**Platform Questions:**
- How do I run containers on k8s?
- How do I wrap NiFi API calls?
- How do I manage cluster lifecycle?
- How do I execute scripts in different environments?

**Solution Questions:**
- How do I process customer data?
- What pipeline steps do I need for this use case?
- How do I compose NiFi + Kafka for real-time analytics?
- What's my data transformation logic?

### 2. Component Encapsulation

Each component is fully self-contained with its own:
- Container images
- Configuration templates
- API wrappers
- Platform-specific deployment manifests

**Example Structure:**
```
components/
├── nifi/
│   ├── container/
│   ├── k8s-templates/
│   └── api-wrappers/
├── kafka/
│   ├── container/
│   ├── k8s-templates/
│   └── api-wrappers/
└── monitoring/
    ├── container/
    ├── k8s-templates/
    └── api-wrappers/
```

### 3. Capability Exposure Through Presence

**Simple Model:**
- Component Present = Capability Available
- Component Absent = Capability Not Available
- No complex dependency management

This enables elegant capability discovery through filesystem scanning.

## Packaging Architecture

### Self-Extracting Archives

The complete flow from source to execution:
```
Git Repository (source) 
    ↓ (InfoMetish packaging)
Self-Extracting Zip (portable package)
    ↓ (extract on target linux/WSL)
Ready-to-Run Solution (containers + scripts + configs)
    ↓ (SPlectrum execution)
Running Platform with Solution
```

### Multi-Platform Component Packages

Each component package contains platform-specific deployment capabilities:

```
nifi-component.zip (self-extracting)
├── container/
│   └── nifi.tar          ← Container image as tar
├── k8s/
│   ├── deployment.yaml   ← k8s templates
│   └── service.yaml      
├── docker/
│   └── compose.yaml      ← Docker templates
├── p2p/                  ← P2P deployment templates
│   ├── discovery.yaml    
│   └── mesh.yaml         
└── scripts/
    ├── deploy-k8s.sh
    ├── deploy-docker.sh
    └── deploy-p2p.sh
```

### Deployment-Ready vs Build-Ready Balance

**Default Packages (Deployment-Ready):**
- Common use cases pre-built
- Immediate deployment capability
- No build dependencies on target
- Optimized for rapid deployment

**Build Setup (JIT Customization):**
- Custom configurations
- Development workflows
- Edge cases and unusual combinations
- Advanced customization needs

## P2P Deployment Considerations

P2P deployment adds specific packaging requirements:
- Peer discovery templates
- Service mesh configurations
- Distributed consensus mechanisms
- Trust and security frameworks

This creates packages that can distribute tools like NiFi with embedded k8s platform capabilities through P2P networks.

## AI Intelligence Requirements

The architectural complexity requires significant AI assistance across:

**Package Intelligence:**
- Template generation
- Dependency resolution
- Configuration synthesis
- Build optimization

**Platform Intelligence:**
- Environment detection
- Capability discovery
- Deployment adaptation
- Resource optimization

**Solution Intelligence:**
- Component composition
- Workflow orchestration
- Conflict resolution
- Performance tuning

**P2P Intelligence:**
- Network topology management
- Consensus mechanisms
- Fault tolerance
- Security coordination

## Composition Flow Example

The quartet working together:

```
Carambah: "I need real-time customer analytics"
    ↓ (composes NiFi + Kafka + monitoring)
InfoMetish: "Package this for k8s cluster"  
    ↓ (creates k8s manifests + configs)
SPlectrum: "Execute this package"
    ↓ (deploys via k8s API)
Sesameh: "Monitor and adapt as needed"
    ↓ (continuous optimization)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Phase: InfoMetis Prototyping
- Mix all concerns to understand patterns
- Validate architectural assumptions
- Discover natural component boundaries
- Build empirical knowledge

### Next Phase: Component Extraction
- Separate platform from solution concerns
- Extract reusable patterns
- Define component interfaces
- Create initial quartet implementations

### Future Phase: Full Quartet Architecture
- Clean component boundaries
- Standardized interfaces
- Composable solutions
- AI-driven orchestration

## Key Insights

1. **Containerization naturally enforces encapsulation** - containers provide the isolation boundaries the quartet architecture needs

2. **Capability through presence** - simple directory scanning replaces complex dependency management

3. **Platform agnostic packaging** - same component works across k8s, Docker, P2P, bare metal

4. **AI is essential, not optional** - the complexity requires intelligent orchestration

5. **InfoMetis validates the vision** - prototyping proves the architectural concepts

## Conclusion

InfoMetis serves as the proving ground for a sophisticated quartet architecture that separates execution (SPlectrum), packaging (InfoMetish), intelligence (Sesameh), and composition (Carambah). Through practical implementation of a data platform, we're discovering the natural boundaries and patterns that will define these future components.

The prototype may seem complex because it contains elements of all four components, but this complexity is intentional - it allows us to understand the full system before decomposing it into its natural parts.
