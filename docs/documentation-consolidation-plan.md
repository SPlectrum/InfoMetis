# InfoMetis Documentation Consolidation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Key Finding
The quartet architecture is already well-defined in `four-layer-meta-platform-architecture.md`, but there's a naming clarification needed:
- **Current**: InfoMetis is described as the "How to Run" platform layer
- **Clarification**: InfoMetis is the prototyping playground; InfoMetish will be the packaging component

### Document Overview

1. **`four-layer-meta-platform-architecture.md`** ✅
   - The definitive quartet architecture document
   - Clearly defines all four layers and their interactions
   - Needs minor update to clarify InfoMetis vs InfoMetish

2. **`infometis-quartet-architecture-vision.md`** (new) ✅
   - Captures today's discussion about InfoMetis as prototyping playground
   - Clarifies the evolution path from InfoMetis to the quartet components
   - Provides implementation insights from prototyping

3. **`infometis-platform-evolution-strategy.md`** 
   - Focuses on InfoMetis evolving into a universal platform abstraction
   - Good technical depth but predates the quartet clarification
   - Should be updated to reflect InfoMetish packaging role

4. **`compositional-repository-architecture.md`**
   - Repository structuring strategy
   - Aligns with quartet composability principles
   - Limited to implementation details

5. **`complete-data-platform-plan.md`**
   - Detailed 10-week implementation plan
   - Example of what can be built with the architecture
   - Doesn't reference quartet concepts

## Consolidation Strategy

### 1. Establish Document Hierarchy

```
docs/
├── architecture/
│   ├── README.md                              ← Architecture overview & navigation
│   ├── quartet-architecture.md                ← Main reference (renamed from four-layer)
│   ├── infometis-prototyping-vision.md      ← Today's insights
│   └── component-specifications/
│       ├── infometish-packaging.md           ← From platform evolution strategy
│       ├── splectrum-execution.md            ← New, to be created
│       ├── carambah-composition.md           ← New, to be created
│       └── sesameh-intelligence.md           ← New, to be created
├── implementation/
│   ├── repository-structure.md               ← From compositional repo architecture
│   ├── packaging-patterns.md                 ← Extract from various docs
│   └── deployment-strategies.md              ← Consolidate deployment approaches
└── examples/
    ├── data-platform/
    │   └── complete-implementation-plan.md   ← From complete data platform plan
    └── nifi-automation/
        └── pipeline-automation-example.md    ← From existing NiFi docs
```

### 2. Key Updates Required

#### Update `four-layer-meta-platform-architecture.md`:
- Rename to `quartet-architecture.md` for clarity
- Add section clarifying InfoMetis (prototyping) vs InfoMetish (future packaging component)
- Add references to component specification documents

#### Create Architecture README:
- Overview of the quartet architecture
- Navigation guide to related documents
- Quick reference for component responsibilities

#### Transform `infometis-platform-evolution-strategy.md`:
- Extract InfoMetish-specific content to `component-specifications/infometish-packaging.md`
- Focus on packaging and deployment capabilities
- Reference main quartet architecture

### 3. Documentation Relationships

```
quartet-architecture.md (main reference)
    ├── References component specifications
    ├── Links to implementation guides
    └── Points to examples

infometis-prototyping-vision.md
    ├── Explains prototyping approach
    ├── Maps current work to future components
    └── Provides architectural insights

Component Specifications
    ├── Detail each quartet component
    ├── Define interfaces and capabilities
    └── Reference implementation patterns

Implementation Guides
    ├── Practical how-to documents
    ├── Repository patterns
    └── Deployment strategies

Examples
    └── Concrete implementations using the architecture
```

### 4. Action Items

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - [ ] Create `docs/architecture/README.md` as navigation hub
   - [ ] Rename and update `four-layer-meta-platform-architecture.md`
   - [ ] Move `infometis-quartet-architecture-vision.md` to architecture folder

2. **Short Term**:
   - [ ] Extract component specifications from existing documents
   - [ ] Create missing component specification documents
   - [ ] Reorganize existing documents into new structure

3. **Medium Term**:
   - [ ] Create implementation guides from patterns discovered
   - [ ] Document packaging patterns and deployment strategies
   - [ ] Add more examples as prototyping progresses

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Clear Navigation**: Developers can easily find relevant documentation
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Each concept documented once in the right place
3. **Better Evolution**: Easy to update as understanding deepens
4. **Improved Onboarding**: New contributors understand the vision quickly

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this consolidation plan
2. Begin with immediate actions (creating navigation hub)
3. Progressively reorganize documents following the structure
4. Update cross-references as documents are moved

*This plan provides a clear path to consolidate InfoMetis documentation around the quartet architecture vision.*
