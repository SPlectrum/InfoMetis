# InfoMetis: Aim & Purpose

## Primary Aim

**InfoMetis is a prototyping playground to validate the quartet architecture through practical implementation.**

## The Quartet Architecture

1. **SPlectrum** - Execution engine (How to Execute)
2. **InfoMetish** - Packaging system (How to Package) 
3. **Sesameh** - AI intelligence (How to Adapt)
4. **Carambah** - Solution composition (How to Compose)

## What InfoMetis Does

InfoMetis combines all quartet components in one project to:
- Test architectural boundaries through real implementation
- Validate packaging and deployment patterns
- Discover natural component separation points
- Build empirical knowledge before final decomposition

## Key Validation Areas

### Platform vs Solution Classification
- Platform capabilities → Future SPlectrum + InfoMetish
- Solution logic → Future Carambah
- Intelligence needs → Future Sesameh

### Packaging Model
- Git repository → Self-extracting archives
- Multi-platform deployment (k8s, Docker, P2P)
- Component encapsulation with configs

### Capability Exposure
- Presence-based capability detection
- No complex dependency management
- Simple folder scanning for available components

## Success Criteria

InfoMetis succeeds when it provides clear answers to:
1. Where should component boundaries be drawn?
2. What packaging patterns work across platforms?
3. How should components communicate?
4. What intelligence is needed for orchestration?

## Current Status

**Version**: v0.1.0 - WSL NiFi Foundation with Simple CAI

Implementing a data platform to validate quartet patterns:
- Container orchestration patterns
- API wrapper designs  
- Configuration composition
- Deployment automation

## Roadmap

Progressive service addition to test different aspects:
- **v0.1.0** ✅ NiFi + Kubernetes (basic orchestration)
- **v0.2.0** → + Registry/Git (version control patterns)
- **v0.3.0** → + Elasticsearch (data service integration)
- **v0.4.0** → + Grafana (monitoring patterns)
- **v0.5.0** → + Kafka (streaming/messaging)

See [detailed roadmap](nifi-wsl-dev-platform/roadmap.md) for full progression.
