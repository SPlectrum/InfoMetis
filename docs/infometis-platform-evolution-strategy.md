# InfoMetis Platform Evolution Strategy

## Vision Statement

InfoMetis evolves from a container orchestration tool into a **Universal Service Platform Abstraction Layer** - the foundational infrastructure that makes any service available on any execution environment through consistent APIs, with containerization as the default deployment model.

## Platform Abstraction Concept

### Core Philosophy
InfoMetis becomes the universal "make services available" platform that:
- **Abstracts execution environments** (Kubernetes, SPL engines, bare metal, cloud services)
- **Provides consistent service APIs** regardless of underlying infrastructure
- **Handles service discovery and networking** across heterogeneous environments
- **Manages deployment lifecycles** independent of platform specifics
- **Defaults to containerized deployment** while supporting alternative execution models

### Execution Environment Targets

#### **Kubernetes Clusters** (Current Focus)
- Traditional containerized services (NiFi, Kafka, databases)
- Scalable, resilient workloads
- Standard cloud-native deployment model

#### **SPL Engines** (Future Focus)
- SPlectrum API packages wrapped in containers
- Lightweight, API-focused microservices
- Custom execution environment optimized for SPlectrum workflows

#### **Bare Metal** (Performance Focus)
- High-performance computing workloads
- Direct hardware access requirements
- Minimal overhead execution

#### **Cloud Services** (Integration Focus)
- Managed service integration (AWS RDS, Azure Functions, etc.)
- Hybrid cloud deployment models
- Service broker patterns

## Three-Tier Platform Evolution

### Tier 1: Service Abstraction Layer
**Universal Service Interface**
```javascript
// Universal service definition
{
  "service": "nifi-pipeline",
  "version": "1.19.0",
  "requirements": {
    "cpu": "2 cores",
    "memory": "4GB",
    "storage": "10GB",
    "network": ["http:8080", "https:8443"]
  },
  "deployment_preferences": [
    "kubernetes",    // Preferred
    "spl-engine",   // Alternative
    "bare-metal"    // Fallback
  ],
  "api": {
    "management": "rest/v1",
    "monitoring": "prometheus/v1",
    "events": "webhook/v1"
  }
}
```

### Tier 2: Execution Environment Adapters
**Environment-Specific Deployment Logic**

#### **Kubernetes Adapter**
```yaml
# InfoMetis → Kubernetes translation
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nifi-pipeline
  labels:
    infometis.service: nifi-pipeline
    infometis.version: 1.19.0
spec:
  # ... kubernetes-specific configuration
```

#### **SPL Engine Adapter**
```javascript
// InfoMetis → SPL Engine translation
{
  "spl_package": "nifi-automation-api",
  "deployment_target": "spl-engine-cluster",
  "container_wrapper": {
    "image": "infometis/nifi-api:1.19.0",
    "spl_mount": "/spl/packages/nifi-automation"
  }
}
```

#### **Bare Metal Adapter**
```bash
# InfoMetis → Bare Metal translation
#!/bin/bash
# Service installation and configuration script
# Generated by InfoMetis for bare metal deployment
```

### Tier 3: Service Discovery and Coordination
**Cross-Platform Service Mesh**
- **Global Service Registry**: Services available across all execution environments
- **Unified Networking**: Consistent service-to-service communication
- **Health and Monitoring**: Environment-agnostic service health checks
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent workload distribution across platforms

## SPlectrum Integration Architecture

### Container-Wrapped SPL Packages

#### **Hybrid Execution Model**
```
Traditional Service (Kubernetes)
    ↕ API Calls
InfoMetis Service Mesh
    ↕ API Calls  
SPL API Package (SPL Engine)
    ↕ Internal Calls
SPL Package Ecosystem
```

#### **SPL Package Containerization**
```dockerfile
# Example: SPlectrum API package as containerized service
FROM alpine:latest
COPY spl-engine /usr/local/bin/
COPY packages/ /spl/packages/
COPY api-wrapper.js /spl/api/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "/spl/api/api-wrapper.js"]
```

#### **Service Definition for SPL Package**
```javascript
{
  "service": "data-transformation-api",
  "type": "spl-package",
  "package": "data-transform/v1.2.0",
  "container": {
    "image": "infometis/spl-runtime:latest",
    "spl_package": "data-transformation-api"
  },
  "deployment_target": "spl-engine-cluster",
  "api": {
    "transform": "POST /api/v1/transform",
    "status": "GET /api/v1/status",
    "health": "GET /health"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

InfoMetis Platform Evolution transforms InfoMetis from a container orchestration tool into a universal service platform abstraction layer. By defaulting to containerization while supporting diverse execution environments like SPL engines, InfoMetis becomes the foundational layer that enables any service to run anywhere, with consistent APIs and seamless integration across the entire technology ecosystem.

This evolution positions InfoMetis as the universal substrate for both traditional cloud-native services and next-generation SPlectrum-powered applications, creating a unified platform for the entire service ecosystem.
