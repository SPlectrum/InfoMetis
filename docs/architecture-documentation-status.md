# Architecture Documentation Status

## Quick Reference

### üéØ The Quartet Architecture
- **SPlectrum**: Execution engine (API wrappers, runtime)
- **InfoMetish**: Packaging & deployment (platform packages)
- **Sesameh**: AI behavioral intelligence
- **Carambah**: Solution composition

### üìç InfoMetis Role
**InfoMetis = Prototyping Playground** where we validate quartet concepts before extracting into separate components.

## Current Documentation

### ‚úÖ Complete & Current
1. **`four-layer-meta-platform-architecture.md`**
   - The definitive quartet architecture reference
   - Needs minor naming clarification (InfoMetis ‚Üí InfoMetish)

2. **`infometis-quartet-architecture-vision.md`** (NEW)
   - Today's insights about InfoMetis as prototyping playground
   - Clarifies evolution path to quartet components
   - Shows platform vs solution classification

### üìù Needs Integration
3. **`infometis-platform-evolution-strategy.md`**
   - Good technical content about universal platform abstraction
   - Should be reframed as InfoMetish packaging specifications

4. **`compositional-repository-architecture.md`**
   - Useful implementation patterns
   - Should become an implementation guide

5. **`complete-data-platform-plan.md`**
   - Excellent example implementation
   - Should move to examples directory

### üîÑ Key Insights from Today

1. **Platform vs Solution Question**
   - "Is it platform?" ‚Üí InfoMetish + SPlectrum
   - "Is it solution?" ‚Üí Carambah

2. **Component Encapsulation**
   - Each tool brings its own configs, containers, and templates
   - YAML templates stay with their components

3. **Capability Through Presence**
   - Component folder present = capability available
   - Simple, elegant, no complex dependencies

4. **Self-Extracting Packages**
   - Git repo ‚Üí InfoMetish packaging ‚Üí self-extracting zip ‚Üí deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Review** `documentation-consolidation-plan.md` for reorganization strategy
2. **Start** with creating architecture README for navigation
3. **Clarify** InfoMetis vs InfoMetish naming in main architecture doc
4. **Extract** component specifications from existing documents

## The Big Picture

InfoMetis contains **all quartet components mixed together** for prototyping:
- Release wrapper scripts (InfoMetish)
- Cluster management (SPlectrum)
- Tool components with configs (InfoMetish)
- Solution compositions (Carambah)
- AI orchestration needs (Sesameh)

This complexity is **intentional** - we're learning where the boundaries should be drawn through practical implementation.
